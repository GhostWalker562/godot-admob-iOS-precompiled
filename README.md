Godot Custom AdMob Mobile Template - iOS
==========

I'm providing an AdMob template for iOS compiled by yours truly. I've used it successfully in my projects and I will try to update it as frequently as possible.

- [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Godot Admob](https://github.com/kloder-games/godot-admob)

I'm only trying to compile the latest **working** version for AdMob.

How to use
----------

- Download the zip file on the [releases tab](https://github.com/GhostWalker562/godot-admob-iOS-precompiled/releases);
- Extract the files on your file system;
- [Export](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_projects.html) your iOS project normally by using the template provided by Godot themselves.
- Put the template provided into the iOS export and rename it to replace the previous .a file.

- For the API (Coding stuff) and further exporting instructions, click > [Godot Admob](https://github.com/kloder-games/godot-admob)
- **Currently I've only compiled 'Release' and so the debug template is not available yet. It takes ages to do one out of two architectures okay.**

Why not Android?
