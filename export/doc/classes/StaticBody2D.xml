	<description>
		Static body for 2D physics. A StaticBody2D is a body that is not intended to move. It is ideal for implementing objects in the environment, such as walls or platforms.
		Additionally, a constant linear or angular velocity can be set for the static body, which will affect colliding bodies as if it were moving (for example, a conveyor belt).

			The physics material override for the body.
			If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.
