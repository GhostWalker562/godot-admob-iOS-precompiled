		[TextureArray]s store an array of [Image]s in a single [Texture] primitive. Each layer of the texture array has its own mipmap chain. This makes it is a good alternative to texture atlases.
		[TextureArray]s must be displayed using shaders. After importing your file as a [TextureArray] and setting the appropriate Horizontal and Vertical Slices, display it by setting it as a uniform to a shader, for example:
		[codeblock]
		shader_type canvas_item;

		uniform sampler2DArray tex;
		uniform int index;

		void fragment() {
		    COLOR = texture(tex, vec3(UV.x, UV.y, float(index)));
		}
		[/codeblock]
		Set the integer uniform "index" to show a particular part of the texture as defined by the Horizontal and Vertical Slices in the importer.
