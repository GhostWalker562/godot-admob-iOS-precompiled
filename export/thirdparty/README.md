Please keep categories (`##` level) listed alphabetically and matching their
respective folder names. Use two empty lines to separate categories for
readability.


## bullet

- Upstream: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
- Version: 2.89 (830f0a9565b1829a07e21e2f16be2aa9966bd28c, 2019)
- License: zlib

Files extracted from upstream source:

- src/* apart from CMakeLists.txt and premake4.lua files
- LICENSE.txt


## certs

- Upstream: Mozilla, via https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ca-certificates
- Version: 2018.2.26 (2018)
- License: MPL 2.0

File extracted from a recent Fedora install:
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem
(It can't be extracted directly from the package,
as it's generated on the user's system.)


## cvtt

- Upstream: https://github.com/elasota/cvtt
- Version: 1.0.0-beta4 (cc8472a04ba110fe999c686d07af40f7839051fd, 2018)
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .cpp, .h, and .txt files in ConvectionKernels/

## embree

- Upstream: https://github.com/lighttransport/embree-aarch64
- Version: 3.12.1 (6ef362f99af80c9dfe8dd2bfc582d9067897edc6, 2020)
- License: Apache 2.0

Files extracted from upstream:

- All cpp files listed in `modules/raycast/godot_update_embree.py`
- All header files in the directories listed in `modules/raycast/godot_update_embree.py`

The `modules/raycast/godot_update_embree.py`script can be used to pull the 
relevant files from the latest Embree-aarch64 release and apply some automatic changes.

Some changes have been made in order to remove exceptions and fix minor build errors.
They are marked with `// -- GODOT start --` and `// -- GODOT end --`
comments. Apply the patches in the `patches/` folder when syncing on newer upstream
commits.


## enet

- Upstream: http://enet.bespin.org
- Version: 1.3.17 (e0e7045b7e056b454b5093cb34df49dc4cee0bee, 2020)
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .c files in the main directory (except unix.c win32.c)
- the include/enet/ folder as enet/ (except unix.h win32.h)
- LICENSE file

Important: enet.h, host.c, protocol.c have been slightly modified
to be usable by Godot's socket implementation and allow IPv6 and DTLS.
Apply the patches in the `patches/` folder when syncing on newer upstream
commits.

Three files (godot.cpp, enet/godot.h, enet/godot_ext.h) have been added to provide
enet socket implementation using Godot classes.

It is still possible to build against a system wide ENet but doing so
will limit its functionality to IPv4 only.
