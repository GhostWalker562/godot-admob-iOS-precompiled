## [3.3] - 2021-04-21

See the [release announcement](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived) for details.

### Added

#### Audio

- [MP3 loading and playback support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43007).
- [Add AudioEffectCapture to access the microphone in real-time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45593).

#### Build system

- [Add `production=yes` option to set optimal options for production builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45593).
  - Users making custom builds should use this option which is equivalent to `use_lto=yes debug_symbols=no use_static_cpp=yes`.
  - **Note for Linux builds:** `use_static_cpp=yes` and `udev=yes` are now the default values, so you need `libudev` and `libstdc++-static` development packages to build in optimal conditions.
- [Add `optimize=none` to disable C/C++ compiler optimizations for release builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46966).
  - This can be used to speed up compile times when working on the engine itself and when debug checks/features aren't desired.

#### Core

- [New dynamic BVH for rendering and the GodotPhysics backends](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901).
  - If you experience a regression in either physics or rendering, you can try [these Project Settings](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901#issuecomment-758618531) to revert back to the previous Octree-based approach and possibly fix the issue. In either case, be sure to report the problem on GitHub.

- [`Image.resize_to_po2()` now accepts an optional "interpolation" parameter, defaulting to bilinear filtering](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44460).
  - Nearest-neighbor filtering can be used for pixel art textures, and will be used automatically when resizing non-power-of-two textures for non-filtered textures in GLES2.
- [`OS.set_environment()` method to set environment variables](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46413).
- [`String.to_wchar()` method to get a PoolByteArray corresponding to a string's `wchar` data](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46343).
- [`String.naturalnocasecmp_to()` method to perform *natural* case-insensitive string comparison for sorting purposes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45957).

- Transform's `FLIP_Y` and `FLIP_Z` constants now work as expected.
- Fixed importing BMP images.
- The positional command-line argument is now only considered to be a scene path if it ends with `.scn`, `.tscn` or `.escn`.

  - This also makes it possible to use file associations or drag-and-drop and have the positional argument parsed by the project.
- The `--audio-driver` and `--video-driver` command-line arguments are now validated; an error message will be printed if an invalid value is passed.
- The `--check-only` command-line argument now returns a non-zero exit code if an invalid script is passed using `--script`.
- Exporting a project via the command-line now returns a non-zero exit code if an error occurred during exporting.

- **Windows:** Line endings are now converted to CRLF when setting clipboard content.
- **Windows:** Getting the path to the Downloads directory using `OS.get_system_dir()` now works correctly.
  - This fixes line endings being invisible when pasting into other applications.
- **macOS:** `OS.get_real_window_size()` and `OS.set_window_size()` are now handled correctly on hiDPI displays.
